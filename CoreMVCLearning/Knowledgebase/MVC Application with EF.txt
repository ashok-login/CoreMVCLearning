Agenda:
* Use Entity Framework Code First with Existing Database approach and show Department deatils.

CREATE TABLE Department
(
	Id int primary key,
	DeptName nvarchar(50) not null,
	Loc nvarchar(50) not null
)
create table Employee
(

Agenda: Use n-Layer architecture to CRUD Department objects.
   Agenda: Write code in Data Access Layer for CRUD operations for Department.
      We need to write interface for all the classes we are about to develop. Implementing classes through interfaces is the coding standard we need to follow. Below is the steps to follow:
	We'll write IDepartmentDAL interface inside DAL/Contracts folder with all the required methods.
	We'll write DepartmentDAL class by implementing IDepartmentDAL interface inside DAL/Implementations folder.
	To be able to successfully implement this methodology, we we need to write code in Startup.cs/ConfigureServices method like below:
	services.AddTransient<IDepartmentDAL, DepartmentDAL>();
	Check the code for more understanding. We need to follow the same approach for all the classes implemented through its corresponding interfaces.
